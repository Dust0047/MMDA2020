                            It is necessary to address the impact it’s got on all of us. Find out

                        <p>Some people might think that coral reefs only can
                            be found in tropical areas, close to the surface.
                            However, this is not the case. Coral reefs can also
                            be found in <span>cold and deep waters.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The reefs found in cold and deep waters are just made by different species, than the reefs

                            are growing in warmer and shallower waters. So coral reefs can almost be found 
                            <span>all around the world</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The largest coral reef can be found by the <span>northern part of Australia’s east coast.</span> This reef
                            is
                            called <span>Great Barrier</span> Reef and contains 2600 induvial reefs that spread over 2000 kilometers.

                        <p>A coral is made by organisms called <span>coral polyps</span>.
                            One coral is most often made up by made many
                            polyps that live together.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coral polyps have the shape of a <span>cylinder</span>.
                            They have a mouth that have tentacles around it,
                            that helps the organism gather food. The polyps
                            are <span>soft</span> until they settle on a stone on the reef,
                            then they begin to use the ions that are in the

                        </p>
                        <p>When you think of corals, you might think of them

                            some corals are colored. A lot of corals are actually more of a <span>brown color</span>. The corals get

                        <p><span>Climate change</span> is one of threats that coral reefs
                            are being exposed to right now. Corals can´t
                            survive if the waters temperature keeps rising.
                            Even a small increase in temperature is deadly
                            for the corals. Climate change has already been
                            the cause of <span>severe bleaching</span> – which means
                            the corals turn white and dies. According to
                            scientist, if the temperature keeps rising at this
                            pace, most of the coral reefs could very well be
                            <span>gone in the next few decades</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Overfishing</span> is another threat to the coral reefs.
                            It is a threat, because if humans catch too many of
                            the fish living on the reef, the entire <span>ecosystem is
                            affected</span>. On healthy coral reefs the fish keep
                            algae growth low. Without the fish keeping the
                            algae down, the coral reefs will end up
                            <span>smothered by the algae</span>.

                            on the corals. Because of the overfishing, the
                            natural threat to the starfish, The Giant Triton,
                            isn’t there to keep the numbers of
                            Crown-of-thorns down. This leads to an
                            increased number of the starfish, that but even more stress on an already challenged coral
                            reef.

                        <p><span>Pollution</span> is also a threat to the coral reefs. Plastic, chemicals and oil pollution is a few
                            of the things that are poisoning the coral reefs. Pollution from farming is another thing that is
                            doing great harm to the coral reefs, because of the increase of nitrogen in the water, which lead
                            to the algae growing faster. </p>
